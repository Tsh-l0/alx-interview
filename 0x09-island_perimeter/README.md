# Island Perimeter

This project is part of the ALX Interview Preparation series and focuses on calculating the perimeter of an island represented in a 2D grid.

## 📍 Problem Statement

Given a 2D grid of integers where:
- `1` represents land
- `0` represents water

The grid contains exactly one island (a connected group of 1s), and the task is to compute the **total perimeter** of that island.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- 2D Arrays (Lists of Lists)
- Iteration using nested loops
- Boundary and adjacency checks
- Conditional logic

## ✅ Function Signature

```python
def island_perimeter(grid):
    """
    Calculates the perimeter of the island in the grid.
    Args:
        grid (list of list of int): 2D map of the island (0s and 1s)
    Returns:
        int: perimeter of the island
    """
