The “0. Star Wars Characters” project requires you to interact with an external API to fetch and display information about Star Wars characters.

To successfully complete this project, you need to be familiar with several key concepts related to web programming, API interaction, and asynchronous programming in JavaScript.

Concepts Needed:

HTTP Requests in JavaScript:

Understanding how to make HTTP requests to external services using the request module or alternatives like fetch in Node.js.

Working with APIs:

Understanding the basics of RESTful APIs and how to interact with them. Parsing JSON data returned by APIs.

Asynchronous Programming:

Managing asynchronous operations with callbacks, promises, and async/await syntax.
Handling API response data asynchronously.

Command Line Arguments in Node.js:

Using the process.argv array to access command-line arguments passed to a Node.js script.

Array Manipulation and Iteration:
Iterating over arrays and manipulating data structures to format and display character names.
